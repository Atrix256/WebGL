		\caption{\textit{Top:} A cubic curve with control points $A,B,C,D$ encoded in a 1d texture.  \textit{Bottom:} Two piecewise curves encoded in a 1d texture.  The control points for the first curve are $A,B,C,D$ and the control points for the second curve are $D,E,F,G$.  If C0 continuitiy is always desired between the curves, a redundant $D$ could be removed to store these curves in 7 pixels instead of 8.}
