TODO:
! finish this.  make sure and finish cleaning up notes in other folder.
 * also review demos, look for anything not mentioned

* bucket the items to cover in importance buckets

* come up with a layout of the paper with the topics

? gather future work here

? will need to gather the other papers to cite

=========================================DONE=========================================

Things we want to cover, in no particular order:
* 1d texture case as an explanation?
* 2d texture case
* 3d texture case
* talk about mixing de casteljeau's algorithm with bernstein form
* explicitly show how bilinear interpolation can be mathematically equivelant to bernstein form.
* talk about size of textures needed with each case of texture dimensions
* mention thgat quadrilinear (and beyond) has further improvements.  show the formula for # of taps per dimension going up etc.
* hw bilinear / hw linear & sw linear/ sw bilinear -> quality differences and how floating point RGBA textures didn't seem to help
* mention perf at all?
* mention usage cases: specular maps, particle color etc (no more "single value" but parametric values).  parameterizable by many things: viewing angle, time, etc.
* talk about combining R,G,B,A for fewer, higher order curves if desired
* mention rotationally encoding curves?
* talk about using anti aliasing to help jaggies?
* mention that curves could be animated -> lerp between two curves over time = same as lerping between control points.
* rational curves. mention 3 rational curves if they share the A, else 2 rational curves if they each want their own weights.
 * limitation: can only use weighting up to 1.0 for etxture formats that want normalized colors. or you can normalize after multiplication (shrink curve)
