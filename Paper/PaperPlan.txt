TODO:

? benefit of texture curves = don't need to know or care what type of curve created baked out data
 * this technique needs the shader program to know what type of curve unfortunately.
 * unless you are just aproximating curve data with some general thing (like... 3 end to end cubic curves always)

? is "uniform constants" an API agnostic term?  If not need to replace it.  Used in Introduction.

? can you pass data buffers to fragment shaders directly? What about with latest APIs?
 * If so, need to update Intro.

? why is your technique ever preferable to uniform constants?
 * asked MJP from gamedev.net why they opted to use textures instead of uniform constants


! avoid first person!

? should i try to do a 4d texture demo??
 * would also want a quadrilinear test then
 * also a quadrilinear baked test.

! do perf test.  hw vs sw bilinear, vs hwsw bilinear
 ? other perf tests?

* might need to test a high order curve vs baked out curve to see how it fares vs baked out curve.
 * like... 8th order curve, or end to end curves.  vs baked out same number of pixels


? re-read "how to write a research paper" link
 * http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf

* come up with a layout of the paper with the topics

* show rick details at some point (when reviewing paper?)
* another journal if needed: http://tog.acm.org/

! might need some shots of interesting graphics things done where the parameters are on curves.
 * particle color over lifetime
 ? what else

* ask graphics friends:
 ? what are some interesting graphics techniques that use curves? (gradients? particle color over lifetime, etc)
 ? do you currently use curves in your shaders? if so, how do you do that?  are they hard coded values, shader constants, baked out in textures?

! need perf and accuracy information (already have accuracy, need perf)

--- goals from JCGT guidelines ---
* Understand how it differs from alternatives
* Know the advantages AND limitations that will likely be encountered in practice
* Immediately integrate it into a production workflow

===========FUTURE WORK===========

? does this have application to bsplines/nurbs? hermite? others?
 * I think it does have application to b-splines.  not sure exact details but i really think it does.  Maybe could get rid of "wasted space" in texture for end to end curves?
 * maybe see if someone else wants to be involved in that paper and see how to apply it to b-splines?
? how about 3d surfaces instead of only 2d curves? bezier triangles (pascals pyramid) or rectangular bezier patches.
? other uses in 2d vector graphics or in 3d?
? can we do different weighting besides u==v to get higher order curves?  like get a cubic curve where B==C, so it has 3 control points but is cubic?

=========================================BRAINSTORM=========================================

Things we want to cover, in no particular order:
* 1d texture case as an explanation?
* 2d texture case
* 3d texture case
* talk about mixing de casteljeau's algorithm with bernstein form
* explicitly show how bilinear interpolation can be mathematically equivelant to bernstein form.
* talk about size of textures needed with each case of texture dimensions
* mention that quadrilinear (and beyond) has further improvements.  show the formula for # of taps per dimension going up etc.
* hw bilinear / hw linear & sw linear/ sw bilinear / also read control points (3 instead of 4!)-> quality differences and how floating point RGBA textures didn't seem to help
* perf results
* mention usage cases: specular maps, particle color etc (no more "single value" but parametric values).  parameterizable by many things: viewing angle, time, etc.  also can be color gradients.
* talk about combining R,G,B,A for fewer, higher order curves if desired. smoother curves for less texture reads too!
* mention rotationally encoding curves?
* talk about using anti aliasing to help jaggies?
* mention that curves could be animated -> lerp between two curves over time = same as lerping between control points.
* rational curves. mention 3 rational curves if they share the A, else 2 rational curves if they each want their own weights.
 * limitation: can only use weighting up to 1.0 for etxture formats that want normalized colors. or you can normalize after multiplication (shrink curve)
* not ideal for vector graphics because this is just good for getting curve point at time t, and not having knowledge of control points.
 * decent for 1d curves, or polar rendered curves, but limited use cases for those.
 * can also do affine transformations to curve point out, or control points before they go in texture.  same result either way.  translation, rotation, scaling (uniform and not), shearing, paralel projection, etc.  not central projection (perspective projection)
* end to end curves
* benefits of end to end curves vs a higher degree curve
 * less computation to evaluate
 * can have discontinuities (dont share tangents) if desired (sometimes desired, more flexibility)
 * technically, could also make it not even share control points!
 * higher degree curves = more texture sampels needed.  End to end curves = fewer.
* compare to baked out curves that use same number of pixels. is this really apples to apples though? can bake out abitrarily complex curve

=========================================ABSTRACT V1=========================================

1. State the problem
2. Say why it’s an interesting problem
3. Say what your solution achieves
4. Say what follows from your solution

1. problem = ??                       There is a desire for graphical parameters to be put onto customizablle curves to get tunable effects.
2. why is it an interesting problem?  You can make really nice looking things that is tuneable by artists.
3. What does my solution achieve?     It leverages core features of the GPU to both efficiently store and evaluate integral and rational Bezier curves of any degree.
4. what follows from my solution?     It gives a way for writers of fragment shaders to easily and efficiently put values on customizable curves.


Modern graphics techniques expose internal parameters to allow re-use and to help seperate the technical implementation from the artistic implementation.

A popular choice is to expose parameters as a customizable curve, but when doing so, the curve is often quantized into a texture for efficiency, leading
to lower quality results, or more resources being used to accomodate higher resolution quantization.

The technique presented in this paper leverages the multidimensional linear interpolation capabilities of texture samplers in modern graphics hardware to allow efficient
storage and evaluation of both integral and rational Bezier curves of any order.

Using this technique, much higher fidelity is possible using the same resource and computational footprints, and there is also limited application towards vector
graphics.
