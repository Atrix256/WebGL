James:
* figure 2 description is confusing
* is it "correct" to call 't' 'time t' or just say 'at t'?
* could drop 3d textures
* figure 12 isn't clear
* testing with 980m doesn't show much difference from 1-3D
 * might try with a slower card

Ian:
Here are my notes so far:

Too long!

Abstract needs to be more concise. Makes it sound like this would be for evaluating parameter animations. If that is intent need to make piecewise discussion more prominent and would also need to show that using this method for piecewise is better than constant evaluation and CPU evaluation. This is basically the elevator pitch for your technique.

Heart of the technique is basically about using texture interpolation hardware to evaluate the curves. Pick one particular curve type and focus on that in paper and move discussion of other types to supplemental materials or blog post. Show why & when using technique is better than using other techniques.

Figure 11. Graph is confusing because the white line is barely visible. Looks like its a highlight of green/red line. Is white line true sin values or shader sin/cos functions (which are taylor approximations)?

"Limited Applications for Vector Graphics" Take this section out. It has to do with using curves not the technique. Talking about when your technique doesn't work doesn't deserve this much text in main paper.

"Performance Characteristics" This is your most important section, but is the smallest. Technique is producing less accurate results so you need to show that you are significantly faster in at least some scenario and preferably that you are faster when correcting the accuracy problems as well. Need to show numbers for the different accuracy levels and maybe it comes out faster if you're evaluating multiple curves?
